      <h4>Formula 1 race results prediction</h4>
      <p>
      This project explores the use of data analysis and machine learning to predict the outcome of Formula 1 races.
      Historical race data was collected, cleaned and analyzed using Python.
      Several supervised learning models were trained to identify performance patterns based on drivers, teams and race features.
      The project highlighted the importance of feature engineering, model evaluation and data quality in motorsport analytics.
